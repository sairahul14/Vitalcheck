00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.610
Hi thank you for taking my C-Sharp basic's course.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.990
Let me quickly give you an overview of what you're going to learn and how to structure a discourse in

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.680
the first section.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.100
I'm going to talk about fundamentals of C-Sharp and Duckman.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.820
One of the questions that a lot of beginners ask is What is the difference between C-Sharp and talkback

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.060
.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.700
So I want to cover that.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.570
I'm also going to talk about C-L our assemblies name spaces and code and stuff like that.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.690
Then over the next two sections I'm going to talk about types and want to talk about primitive and primitive

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.630
types.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.290
Now I this point you still cannot write any C-Sharp program but you have designed a number of quizzes

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.650
to help you reinforce what you want to learn then from Section 4 where I talk about control flow.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.450
You're going to start writing simple programs.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.150
And from that section on whereas in every section you're going to learn something new about C-Sharp

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
and you get to write more interesting programs.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
And finally I'm going to conclude this course with a section on debugging.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.060
So I'm going to show you some of the tools we have.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.690
So when you have both in your code you know how to find them and get rid of them.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.860
I'm also going to talk about some good programming practices that help you write better and more reliable

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.370
code.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.790
So we have a lot to cover.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.460
And let's get started.
