Hi my name is Mark Hamadan.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.090
And in case you haven't seen my other courses Here's a brief introduction about me and my story.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.470
I started programming at the age of seven with a Commodore 64 and I totally fell in love with it.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.510
My dream back then was to become a software engineer and build a 3D tennis game for myself to play.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.190
So that dream affected the rest of my life.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.030
I continue the education at the university and study Bachelor of Science in software engineering and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.980
Master of Science network system.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.330
Now the reality is I never became a game developer.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.680
In fact I know nothing about games in late 90s where I was a big thing.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.050
A lot of companies needed a website.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.580
So I started working professionally from year 2000 and at this point in year 2015 I have 15 years of

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.980
professional experience in that industry.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.290
In case you're wondering what my life is outside of programming I love to play with a jazz piano.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.510
I love cooking and I love Latin dancing.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.480
I've been dancing for a few years and I love betrothal salsa and Cha-Cha.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.210
So if you're watching this from South America or Spain all are was.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.860
That's pretty much all Spanish I know.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.270
If you want to find me on social media I have a block under program with Losh dot com.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.180
I also have a Facebook page and a YouTube channel by the same name.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.470
You can find me on Twitter under Marsh Ramadani and my email is program with Marsh at g mail dot com

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.110
.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.770
I hope you enjoy this course and always see you in the next lecture.
